While no one person or Grand Lodge can write for Freemasonry, the Grand Lodge Committee on Masonic Education feels the following list of books is a good place for non-Masons to start learning about Freemasonry.  Freemasonry is unique in that every Masonic author is free to express his personal views about what Freemasonry means to him.  Each Grand Lodge or Grand Jurisdiction is free to publish materials for the guideline of its membership. The information published by the Grand Lodge, A.F. & A.M., of the Commonwealth of Virginia for instance, is only for the guidance of the Masons who are members of Lodges chartered by the Grand Lodge of Virginia. We trust you will enjoy reading about the world’s oldest and largest Fraternity known as Freemasonry. While it is enjoyable to read about, one must experience Freemasonry for himself to truly enjoy the beautiful moral meanings and lessons taught within the three degrees.  Freemasonry cannot be learned except by experience.
